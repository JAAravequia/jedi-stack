# valid options include:
# native-module: load a pre-existing module (common for HPC systems)
# native-pkg: use pre-installed executables located in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin,
#             as installed by package managers like apt-get or hombrewo.
#             This is a common option for, e.g., gcc/g++/gfortrant
# from-source: This is to build from source
